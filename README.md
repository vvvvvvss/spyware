Spyware is software that can secretly record your activity on your computer. 
Most commonly, it is delivered through a free download or from an infected email attachment; this is known as a Trojan horse. 
A simple click is enough to install spyware on your computer without your knowledge. 
Once installed, spyware hides in the operating system and becomes transparent to you. 
This makes it difficult to detect and even harder to uninstall. 
With spyware running in the background, you are at risk of exposing confidential information, such as Web surfing habits, passwords, email addresses, and so on.
